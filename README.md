### The App Scenario:

After selecting songs from your device, they will be saved in database and will be displayed in a playlist. Besides when a list item
is clicked, the song player page is displayed whereas player service is run in the background
and notification will be displayed at top of the screen.(Clicking on notification has been handled!)
Also if you click long on the song item of playlist, it will be removed both from your stored and displayed playlist.
